DESCRIPTION-
Project Title: Interactive Quiz Application Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Introduction-

The Interactive Quiz Application is a simple, web-based project designed and developed using core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective of this project is to create an engaging and educational quiz platform where users can answer multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback, and view their final score. It aims to simulate a real-time quiz environment commonly used in online learning platforms and competitive exam preparation apps.

Objective

The goal of this project is to build a responsive, interactive quiz app that dynamically loads questions, highlights correct and incorrect answers, and calculates the user’s score. The project focuses on making the user experience smooth, informative, and visually clear. It also emphasizes improving JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and user interface design.

Technology Stack

HTML5 – Used to structure the quiz content and define the layout of the application.

CSS3 – Applied to style the quiz interface, enhance user experience, and make it responsive on various screen sizes.

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Used to handle dynamic question loading, user interaction, scoring, and real-time feedback.

Features

1. Dynamic Question Loading:
All questions are stored as an array of objects in JavaScript and are displayed dynamically one after the other without reloading the page.

2. Multiple Choice Answers:
Each question has four possible answers. The user selects one option and receives immediate visual feedback.

3. Instant Feedback:
When a user selects an answer, the button color changes—green for the correct answer and red for the wrong one. This helps learners instantly recognize mistakes.

4. Score Calculation:
The app keeps track of the user’s score. At the end of the quiz, the final score is displayed along with a completion message.

5. Quiz Restart Option:
After completing the quiz, the user has the option to restart and take the quiz again from the beginning.

6. Responsive Design:
The layout and design are fully responsive, working well across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

7. GitHub Pages Deployment:
The entire project is hosted online using GitHub Pages, allowing anyone to access and use the quiz through a public link.

Learning Outcomes

This project helped improve my understanding of how to manage data structures in JavaScript, especially arrays and objects. It also deepened my knowledge of how to dynamically update HTML content using JavaScript and how to create clean and responsive layouts using CSS. Additionally, I learned how to host static websites using GitHub Pages, making my project publicly accessible.

Conclusion-

The Interactive Quiz Application is a beginner-friendly but highly practical project that combines design and logic. It serves as a strong demonstration of essential front-end development skills and can be enhanced further with advanced features like a timer, login system, database integration, or question randomization. Hosting the project online through GitHub Pages makes it easy to share with others or include in a portfolio for future opportunities.
